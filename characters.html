					<p>Piper Elizabeth Chapman (Taylor Schilling) is a woman who was sentenced to 15 months in Litchfield Penitentiary for helping her former girlfriend Alex Vause smuggle drug money in Europe several years before the first episode. At the series start, Piper appears to be a somewhat innocent woman who strives to be on her best behavior and not get in trouble with any of the inmates while doing her time quietly. However, throughout the series, as she spends more time in prison, a darker side of Piper is revealed.</p>

					<p>Alex Vause (Laura Prepon) is a former drug smuggler for an unspecified international drug cartel. Years prior to the beginning of the series, she took a sexual interest in Piper after meeting her in a bar, and gradually integrated her into the drug trade while they traveled the world living in luxury. Alex is snarky, manipulative and street smart. While she does associate with other inmates, she keeps to herself emotionally, although she isn't afraid to fight back if provoked. </p>

					<p>Suzanne "Crazy Eyes" Warren (Uzo Aduba) is a mentally unstable inmate with a violent history, however generally passive and friendly.

Suzanne was often shunned by her parents' community and her little sister's friends.  She is easily upset and is quickly frustrated, usually resulting in her hitting herself on the head and calling herself "stupid."  When getting to know her better, her compassion and thoughtfulness become apparent.</p>
